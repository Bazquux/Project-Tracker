Camel

A Captain in the foreign legion was transferred to a desert outpost. On his
orientation tour he noticed a very old, seedy looking camel tied out back
of the enlisted men's barracks. He asked the Sergeant leading the tour,
"What's the camel for?".

The Sergeant replied "Well sir it's a long way from anywhere, and the men
have natural sexual urges, so when they do, uh, we have the camel."

The captain said "Well if it's good for moral, then I guess it's all right
with me."


After he had been at the fort for about 6 months the captain could not
stand it any more so he told his Sergeant, "BRING IN THE CAMEL!!!" The
sarge
shrugged his shoulders and led the camel into the captains quarters.

The captain got a foot stool & proceeded to have vigorous sex with the
camel. As he stepped, satisfied, down from the stool, and was buttoning his
pants he asked the Sergeant, "Is that how the enlisted men do it?"

The Sergeant replied, "Well sir, they usually just use it to ride into

town."
