Blonde

One day while on patrol, a police officer pulled over a car for speeding.
He went up to the car and asked the driver to roll down her window.
The first thing he noticed, besides the nice red sports car, was how
hot the driver was!  Drop dead blonde, the works.

"I've pulled you over for speeding, Ma'me.... could I see your drivers
license...?"

"...What's a license...???" replied the blonde, instantly giving away
the fact that she was as dumb as a stump..

"It's usually in your wallet..." replied the officer.  After fumbling for a

few minutes, the driver managed to find it.
"Now may I see your registration..." asked the cop.

"Registration..... what's that.....?" asked the blonde.  "It's
usually in your glove compartment..." said the cop impatiently.
After some more fumbling, she found the registration.  "I'll
be back in a minute..." said the cop and walked back to his car.

The officer phoned into the dispatch to run a check on the woman's
license and registration.  After a few moments, the dispatcher

came back;

"Ummm.... is this woman driving a red sports car?"

"Yes...." replied the officer

"Is she a drop dead gorgeous blonde?" asked the dispatcher

"Uh... yes" replied the cop.

"Here's what you do...." said the dispatcher.  "Give her the stuff
back, and drop your pants..."

"WHAT!!? I can't do that.  Its..... inappropriate..." exclaimed the cop.

"Trust me..... just do it...." said the dispatcher.

So the cop goes back to the car, gives back the license and

registration and drops his pants, just as the dispatcher said.

The blonde looks down and sighs..... "Ohh no... not ANOTHER
breathalyzer.."
