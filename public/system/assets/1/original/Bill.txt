Bill

Bill rents an apartment in New York, and goes to the lobby to put his
name on the group mailbox. While he was there, an attractive young
lady comes out of  the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing a robe.
Bill smiles at the young girl and she strikes up a conversation with
him. As they talk, her robe slips open, and it's quite obvious that she
has nothing under the robe.  Poor Bill breaks out into a sweat trying
to maintain eye contact.  After a few minutes, she places her  hand on

his arm and says, "Let's go in  my apartment, I hear someone
coming..."

He proceeds with her into the apartment, and after she closes the
door, she leans against it allowing her robe to fall off completely.
Being completely nude, she purrs at  him, "What would you say is my
best feature?" The flustered, embarrassed Bill stammers, clears his
throat several times, and finally squeaks out, "Oh, it's got to be
your ears!" She's astounded! "Why my ears? Looks at these breasts!

They are full, don't sag, and they're 100% natural! My buns - they are
firm and do not sag, and have no cellulite! Look at this skin, no
blemishes, or scars!     Why in heaven's name  would you say my ears
are the best part of my body?!"

Clearing his throat once again, Bill stammers - "Outside when you said
you  heard someone coming - That was me!"
